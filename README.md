Hi There, I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Researcher, Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
I created this repository to save, share, and showcase some of my data science related projects, knowledge, and techniques.
Amongst the projects, I divided it into multiple series, in which some are short and simple while other requires longer timeframe of delication and learning. Also, I included some technique-oriented project which focuses on sharing particular method or skill.
I will be consistently updating and adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe.
If there is no embeded link in the project index, that means it's under work, please come back later.<br/><br/>
Please contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chun-kit-tan-b13747151/) if you are looking to hire a data scientist.

### Portfolio:
#### <ins>Project Series</ins>
Larger project that requires weeks/months of works, in which I contribute partly and slowly. Unlike Publication Formatted Series, this series contains only codings and markdown file. <br/>
1. [Stock AI](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/stock-ai/tree/main) (multi-project)
2. [Google Search Scrapper](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Google-Scrapper/blob/main/Scrapper.ipynb)
3. I Want To Be a Medium Author: An Analysis on Reader Preferences
4. You Want to be a Youtuber: Factors that Affect Video View Rate
5. Do Politician speaks to win or speaks to serve?: A Descriptive Analytics aided by Text Mining. 

#### <ins>Publication / Assignment Formatted Series</ins>
Similar to Project Series but formatted according to certain publisher requirements, included writing part such as literature review, methodology, result etc. Please contact me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chun-kit-tan-b13747151/) if you are looking for co-author in your ML topics, or interested in sponsoring my unpublished article / assignment
1. [(IJACSA Published) K Means Clustering on Customer Profiling Using LRFMP Model](https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=12&Issue=1&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=14)
2. [(Unpublished) Quantitative Systematic Literature Review Using Text Mining and Latent Dirichlet Allocation Using Orange](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Text-Mining-and-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-Using-Orange/blob/main/Current%20State-of-the-art%20of%20Research%20in%20Data%20Governance%20(Revised)%20Tan%20Chun%20Kit.pdf)
3. [(Unpublished) Hadoop Parrellel Processing Comparison: Hadoop MapReduce vs Pig](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Hadoop-MapReduce-and-Pig/blob/main/Capabilities%20Hadoop%20F2.pdf)
4. [(Assignment) Utilizing Hadoop and Power BI for Machine Learning and Data Visualiation Using Online Streaming Service Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/The-Application-of-Hadoop-on-Online-Streaming-Service-Provider-Industry/blob/main/CC%20GROUP%20COMPILING%20V2.docx)

#### <ins>Technical Series</ins>
Instead of specifying on the uses of certain ML method, this series focus on some technical aspect that could be part of one or some ML learning method or part of a data processing pipline, which means anything technical-oriented between ETL and Data Visualization will be included in this series

1. [Methods That are Capable of Batch Processing](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/ML-Methods-Capable-to-Batch-Processing/blob/main/MLs%20and%20Batch%20Processing.ipynb)<br/>
2. [Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, RF, FA) for Data Visualization Purpose](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Dimensionality-Reduction-For-Data-Visualization/blob/main/DRforDV.ipynb)<br/>
3. [Data Transformation: Pupose and Usage](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Datat-Transformation--Purpose-and-Usage/blob/main/Data%20Transformation%20Usage%20and%20Purpose.ipynb)<br/>
4. [Random and Non-Random Missing Value Imputation Using Statistical and ML Methods](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/missing-value-imputation/blob/main/Missing%20value%20Imputation.ipynb)<br/>
5. [Spark SQL Demonstration on Databrick Cloud Platform](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Spark-SQL-Course-Demonstration) (multi-project)<br/>
6. Complex Data Pivotting using Python Pandas<br/>


#### <ins>Tensorflow / Keras Series</ins>
Tensorflow and Keras on its own, is huge enough to talk about as a series. This series look into various ML questions that can be answer through the implementation of tf and Keras. With that in mind, this series will focus on large and complex data that challenge the conventional ML techniques, whicih may includes image / video recognition, and text mining.

#### <ins>Unboxing Series</ins>
Instead of adopting the readily available package for machine learning, this series intended to build machine learning algorithm from bottom up. The purpose is to learn and understand the complex mathematical methods behind the method as well as reduce the dependencies.


 I [archived](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/archived-portfolio/blob/main/README.md) some series and articles to prevent overclouding.
