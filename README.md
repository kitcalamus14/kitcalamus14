### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
### After years of study, working (mostly freelancing), and self-learning, I think it's time for me to create my own repository to share and showcase my knowledge
### I will be consistently adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe
### Here is my first project [Naive Bayes on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Simple-Naive-Bayes/blob/master/NB%20iris-checkpoint.ipynb)
