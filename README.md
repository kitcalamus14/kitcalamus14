### Hi there 👋
### I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
### After years of study, working (mostly freelancing), and self-learning, I think it's time for me to create my own repository to share and showcase my knowledge
### I will be consistently adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe

### INDEX
### Simple Series
### This part of the portfolio mainly covers the most easy and general uses of machine learning techniques (mostly on Iris dataset)
### While keeping things simple, I will attempted to makes the realistic and useful coding (eg. to retrieve the iris dataset from uci repository instead of loading it from sklearn package)
### Furthermore, at least 1 parameter tuning will be used apart from the default one and discussion is included
### 1. [Naive Bayes on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Simple-Naive-Bayes/blob/master/NB%20iris-checkpoint.ipynb)
