Hi There, I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
I created this repository to save, share, and show case some of my data science related projects, knowledge, and techniques.
Amongst the projects, I divided it into multiple series, in which some are short and simple while other requires longer timeframe of delication and learning. Also, I included some technique-oriented project which focuses on sharing particular method or skill.
I will be consistently adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe.
If there is no embeded link in the project index, that means it's under work, please come back later =D.<br/>
Please contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chun-kit-tan-b13747151/) if you are looking to hire a data scientist.

### Projects:
Long and complex projects.
#### <ins>Simple Series</ins>
This part of the portfolio mainly covers the most easy and general uses of machine learning techniques (mostly on Iris dataset). While keeping things simple, I attempted to code it as practical as possible (eg. to retrieve the iris dataset from uci repository instead of loading it from sklearn package). Furthermore, at least 1 parameter tuning will be used apart from the default one and discussion is included. These codes will serve as the reference in the following series where I implement a more complex method and with more parameter and hyperparameter tuning using various complex datasets.<br/>

### <ins>Project Series</ins>
1. Image to text recognition from scrap.  
2. Do Politician speaks to win or speaks to serve?: A Descriptive Analytics aided by Machine Learning Algorithm.  


### <ins>Technical Series</ins>
Instead of specifying on the uses of certain ML method, this series focus on some technical aspect that could be part of one or some ML learning method or part of a data processing pipline, which means anything technical-oriented between ETL and Data Visualization will be included in this series

1. [Methods that are capable of batch processing](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/ML-Methods-Capable-to-Batch-Processing/blob/main/MLs%20and%20Batch%20Processing.ipynb)<br/>
2. Small talk: The differences between various ML methods<br/>
3. Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization purpose<br/>
4. Data Transformation and it's pupose and usage<br/>
5. Complex Data Pivotting using Python Pandas<br/>
