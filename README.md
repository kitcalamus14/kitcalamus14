Hi There, I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
I created this repository to save, share, and show case some of my data science related projects, knowledge, and techniques.
Amongst the projects, I divided it into multiple series, in which some are short and simple while other requires longer timeframe of delication and learning. Also, I included some technique-oriented project which focuses on sharing particular method or skill.
I will be consistently adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe.

Please contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chun-kit-tan-b13747151/) if you are looking to hire a data scientist.

### Projects:

Simple Series<br> 
This part of the portfolio mainly covers the most easy and general uses of machine learning techniques (mostly on Iris dataset). While keeping things simple, I will attempted to code it as practical as possible (eg. to retrieve the iris dataset from uci repository instead of loading it from sklearn package). Furthermore, at least 1 parameter tuning will be used apart from the default one and discussion is included. These codes will serve as the reference in the following series where I implement a more complex method and with more parameter and hyperparameter tuning using various complex datasets.<br/>
1. [Naive Bayes on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Simple-Naive-Bayes/blob/master/NB%20iris-checkpoint.ipynb)<br/>
2. [Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Logistic-Regression-on-Iris/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Iris.ipynb)<br/>
3. [K Nearest Neighbour on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/K-Nearest-Neighbor-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/K-Nearest%20Neighbour%20on%20Iris.ipynb)<br/>
4. [Support Vector Machines on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Support-Vector-Machine-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/SVM.ipynb)<br/>
5. [Decision Tree on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Decision-Tree-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20on%20Iris.ipynb)<br/>
6. [Random Forest on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Random-Forest-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/Random%20Forest%20on%20Iris.ipynb)<br/>
7. [Neural Networks on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Neural-Network-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20on%20Iris%20Dataset.ipynb)<br/>

#### Technical Series
#### Instead of specifying on the uses of certain ML method, this series focus on some technical aspect that could be part of one or some ML learning method. Furthermore, I will also includes and study any knowledge and coding that couldn't be useful on its on, but rather a component as part of the data processing pipeline (anything from ETL to Data Visualization)

#### 1. [Methods that are capable of batch processing](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/ML-Methods-Capable-to-Batch-Processing/blob/main/MLs%20and%20Batch%20Processing.ipynb)
#### . Small talk: The differences between various ML methods
#### . Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization purpose
#### . Data Transformation and it's pupose and usage
#### . Complex Data Pivotting using Python Pandas

#### Project Series
#### . Image to text recognition from scrap.
#### . Do Politician speaks to win or speaks to serve?: A Descriptive Analytics aided by Machine Learning Algorithm.
