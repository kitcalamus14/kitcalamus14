### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Chun Kit Tan, a Data Scientist (student maybe?) from Malaysia.
### After years of study, working (mostly freelancing), and self-learning, I think it's time for me to create my own repository to save, share and showcase my knowledge
### I will be consistently adding project on both small and large scale, which may also include some I develop and update continuously in a longer timeframe

### INDEX
#### Simple Series
##### This part of the portfolio mainly covers the most easy and general uses of machine learning techniques (mostly on Iris dataset). While keeping things simple, I will attempted to makes the realistic and useful coding (eg. to retrieve the iris dataset from uci repository instead of loading it from sklearn package). Furthermore, at least 1 parameter tuning will be used apart from the default one and discussion is included. These codes will serve as the reference in the following series where I implement a more complex method and with more parameter and hyperparameter tuning using various complex datasets.
#### Classification
#### 1. [Naive Bayes on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Simple-Naive-Bayes/blob/master/NB%20iris-checkpoint.ipynb)
#### 2. [Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/Logistic-Regression-on-Iris/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Iris.ipynb)
#### 3. [K Nearest Neighbour on Iris Dataset](https://github.com/kitcalamus14/K-Nearest-Neighbor-on-Iris-Dataset/blob/main/K-Nearest%20Neighbour%20on%20Iris.ipynb)
#### . K Means Clustering on Iris Dataset (Click in if you have been taught that K-Means is for unsupervised learning)
#### . Support Vector Machines on Iris Dataset
#### . Decision Tree
#### . Random Forest on Iris Dataset
#### . Neural Networks on Iris Dataset

#### Technical Series
#### Instead of specifying on the uses of certain ML method, this series focus on some technical aspect that could be part of one or some ML learning method. Furthermore, I will also includes and study any knowledge and coding that couldn't be useful on its on, but rather a component as part of the data processing pipeline (anything from ETL to Data Visualization)

#### . Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization purpose
#### . Methods that are capable of batch processing
